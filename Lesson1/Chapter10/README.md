in Solidity the function declaration contains the type of the return value. In our case we are going to implement a new function that generates random dna for the zombie.

As this function will be used to view some of our contracts variable but not modify them we are going to mark it as view0.4.250.4.25 and set the return type of the function when we declare it because it will return randomised uint later.
