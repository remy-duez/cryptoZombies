In the Ethereum blockchain there are accounts that have a balance of Ether (the currency) that you can send and receive. Each account has an **address** that is a unique identifier to the account.

That can help us give a unique ID of ownership to our Zombies.

We are also going to use **mappings**. It's another way to store organized data (just as arrays and structs). It's essentially a key-value store for storing and looking up data.
