Some contracts can be declared as Ownable. These contracts have an owner who has special privileges.

We can use an **Ownable** contract to inherit its methods. If you name a function like the contract ( for instance Ownable + function Ownable), this function will be considered as a **constructor** and be used when the contract is created. 

The **modifiers** are half-functions that can modify other functions. They are often used to verify conditions before the execution.
